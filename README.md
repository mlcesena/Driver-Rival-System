# Driver Rival System

Driver Rival System (DRS - pun intended) is an interactive comparison and information tool for Formula 1.

Users can match up drivers head to head and compare their performance with one another. You can view a variety of different statistics and background information about each driver. Beyond this, DRS also allows for the comparison between teams, as well as key details about each of them. Additionally, detailed insights are provided for all of the active circuits, giving an in-depth look at what makes them all unique. For users who are new to F1 or want a general refresher, there is another page containing all sorts of information on the sport, common terms, and some of the rules/other specifics.

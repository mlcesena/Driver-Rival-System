# Driver Rival System

Driver Rival System (DRS - pun intended) is a comparison tool to matchup current and former Formula 1 drivers.

Users can view a variety of different statistics about each driver from each of their active seasons. Additionally, background information, including their current team, driver number, and more is presented on their driver card. DRS offers a clean UI inspired by 1960's racing media and print.
